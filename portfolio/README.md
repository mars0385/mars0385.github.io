This is my final Responsive Web Design coding project. Designed and thought out in my User Experience Design class, the site was coded from scratch using CSS Grid and flexbox.
All images and content are my own, created from scratch for the project. The main issue I faced while creating the portfolio site was figuring out the actually portfolio page.
Creating a layout for the grids that cause them to properly fit, while also trying to display the images the best I could proved to be difficult and I wasn't sure how to approach that.
Creating the portfolio allowed me to have a deeper understanding of CSS Grids and in css background images, especially trying to get the background images of the home page to have a different opacity as the content.
